# Appendix B - Problem Statement

## Project Title: Secure System Call Interface

### Objective
To develop a secure and interactive web-based system that simulates operating system-level system calls using Python Flask and HTML.

### Problem Definition
Operating systems provide numerous system calls to interact with kernel services, but running them directly poses security and permission risks. This project provides a **sandboxed interface** to simulate such calls safely via a browser.

### Expected Outcome
A working Flask web application with routes for simulated system calls (open, read, write), user authentication, and logging of each system call event, ensuring safe and educational system interaction.
